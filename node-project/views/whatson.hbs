            Sistine Chapel. Avoid the long ticket lines and then enjoy your visit at your own pace. 
             Wander through the Greek Cross Gallery to see elaborately-carved sarcophagi that might just contain the earthly remains of some of
              antiquity's famous kings and queens. Peek at the Cabinet of the Masks, or tour the Sala degli Animali to see a virtual menagerie of 
              fantastic beasts, real and imagined. Walk the Upper Galleries, including the Gallery of Maps, to see how cartographers depicted the
             world through the ages. See masterpieces by Renaissance masters in the Raphael Rooms, and rest for a while in the Borgia Apartments. 
             Then, it's time to marvel at Michelangelo's exquisite Sistine Chapel, the crown jewel of the Vatican, and perhaps even of all the 
             world's art treasures.</p>
